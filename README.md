# finalYearProjectReport
The report for my final year project, version-controlled so that changes are clear and dated.
The final year project consists of 6 major sections, each of has a definition implemented by the sub-sections. 
The whole file has been written and edited by me, Denislav Rofetov and it's purpose is to help me present the product to a non 
familiar user.
